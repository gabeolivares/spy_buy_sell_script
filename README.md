<h1>K-Nearest Neighbors Trading Strategy</h1>
This is a Ruby script that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to generate buy and sell signals for a given stock. The script fetches historical price data for the stock from the Financial Modeling Prep API, calculates the Relative Strength Index (RSI) using the TechnicalAnalysis gem, and then uses the KNN algorithm to predict whether the stock price will go up or down on the next day. Based on this prediction, the script generates a buy or sell signal and calculates the profit or loss for each day.

<h3>Dependencies</h3>
To run this script, you will need
-Ruby 2.6 or higher</br>
-The net/http and json libraries, which are included with Ruby</br>
-The technical_analysis gem, which can be installed using </br>

```gem install technical_analysis```

<h3>Usage</h3>
To use this script, simply run it from the command line:</br>

```ruby knn_trading_strategy.rb```


By default, the script fetches historical price data for the SPY ETF and generates buy and sell signals using a K value of 18. You can modify these parameters by editing the stock_symbol and k variables in the script.

<h3>Output</h3>
The script outputs the profit or loss for each day based on the buy and sell signals generated by the KNN algorithm, as well as the total profit or loss for the last 15 days.
